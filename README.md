# Teenie Search: In-Gallery App

A custom search application created for Carnegie Museum of Art's Teenie Harris Archive. The Teenie Harris Archive is a collection of over 50,000 negatives, which have been digitally scanned. For this application, the exisiting metadata records were enchanced by python text analysis and additional [image analysis](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/TeenieHarrisProject). The search is powered by Algolia.

Targets:

#### `npm run build`
Runs build script in the client directory (see below) 

#### In the *client* directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
